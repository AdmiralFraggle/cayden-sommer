“and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.” **Revelation 21:3**

### What Does This Mean?

This is God’s ultimate, final, victory. His biggest goal. The glorious ending to his plan. To be **WITH US** and to be **OUR GOD**. Yet right now he is with us and he is our God. But this Earth doesn’t feel like heaven. Because sin is a terrible viral disease, that is spreading and has covered the earth. And even though as christians we are divorced from the punishment of sin, we still deal with it’s natural consequences. But God is not finished. So we have a hope. One that is placed in the events of the past (the messiah has come and is now ruler king over everything) AND the future (one day everything that is separating us from God will be fully removed) and then, the dwelling place of God will be with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them as their God.
