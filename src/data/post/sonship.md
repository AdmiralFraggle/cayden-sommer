Reading Scripture through the lens of sonship is powerful—knowing that I was handpicked by God to be for Him. He is so hard to resist. How beautiful and great is He!

He’s the great “I AM.” His name **is** the simple **truth** of His existence. He just **is**. He needs nothing—no frame of reference, no prerequisites. He created everything I know, and He can give or take it all away. He created me! In love, He designed a way of life for me to follow in peace.

However, knowing full well what I was doing, I disobeyed Him and ran from Him. In doing so, I broke His heart and deserved His wrath. Additionally, I had corrupted my mind and body, leading to complete despair and waywardness. There was no way for me to fix myself. There wasn’t even a way to come to my senses.

But like Paul on the Damascus road, God decided He wanted me. “He is my chosen instrument.”

Except there are many problems with that.

First off, my heart was attracted to and following idols. Love for God was nowhere to be found in my heart.

Second, I was deserving of Hell for my **past** actions. There’s nothing I can do to change them or earn anything else. God had to make a way.

What love… He doesn’t need **a thing** from me. “He is not served by human hands.” Yet He displayed His love by giving **everything** to get me.

I was **separated** because of my sin. I needed forgiveness. I needed atonement.

So God gave **everything** to get me. He gave His very own Son to have me. And now I stand in the aftermath—I stand redeemed, restored, a person dedicated to the Lord.
