## Focus

Focus is saying no to everything except the thing you want most. Paul was focused. He was focused not on his works though. He wasn’t focused or “centered on the gospel” either. He was focused on God’s glory, demonstrated by his abundant grace. The more I read the new testament the more convinced of this I am. He is sold out not because of what he can do for God or even what God can do through him, he’s simply sold out because he knows who God is, and he knows God’s glory because he experienced God’s grace. “I live by faith in the son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me”. Paul’s mission (as it appears to me) is to multiply God’s glory here on Earth. knowing that one day he will Partake in the ULTIMATE PLEASURE: the worship of a good and Holy God, with no body or any Earthly thing keeping us from union with God. Until then however, he can’t help but tell everyone about the grace of God demonstrated in the son. He tells of the grace of God in order that God may be more glorified and worshipped. The vehicle of which, is making disciples who form churches that multiply disciples and churches.

### The Method

**Entry** → **Gospel** (tell of God’s grace and invite to respond) → **Disciple** (teach them how to worship, by giving their lives as a living sacrifice to God (romans 12:1) → **Church** (Do it all. together. So that you can do it better)

### Final Takeaway

**IT IS ALL ONLY ABOUT GODS GLORY. AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.**
