    <Fragment slot="title"> About Us </Fragment>

    <Fragment slot="subtitle">
      My passion above all else is in sharing the love of Jesus with anyone and everyone. 
        My God has been so overwhelmingly gracious to me that my only response is to share that love with others.
      
        Over the last few years, I've been diving deep into these topics listed below.
        I consider the Great Commission to be my life's task, and Disciple Making Movements are the vehicle through which we can see it fulfilled!
        My secondary passion is small business.
        I have learned a lot from my brothers overseas, specifically in Rwanda, Africa.
        What I have learned is that it is possible to bring the Kingdom of God into the world through small businesses and the networks they create.
        I am so excited to see what God has planned in bringing His Kingdom to my city through DMMs and Kingdom-minded small businesses.
